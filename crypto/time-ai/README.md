Crown Sterling, of TIME AI™ fame, has recently publicized a new Lite Paper. Alongside their new cryptocurrency, they announced an exciting and novel encryption scheme: "Leveraging new discoveries in compression technology and mathematical constants, the team of mathematicians at Crown Sterling have engineered CrownEncryptOTP™, an enhanced One-Time Pad encryption technology that allows for practical and scalable use of One-Time Pads." They claim that their technique is "designed to exploit the by-default randomness of irrational numbers.".
