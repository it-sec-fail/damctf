What would you like to do? (w - go north, a - go west, s - go south, d - go east, x - write something, m - show map, q - give up): 
Your magnificently magestic magic marker magically manifests itself in your hand. What would you like to write?
Welcome to Zonk, the best text based adventure ever created!
It's a beautiful day. Birds are singing, and a gentle breeze whistles through the trees. Suddenly, the wind shifts, the birds stop singing, and the ground under your feet begins to feel rather insubstantial.
What would you like to do?
Oh no! The ground gives way and you fall into a dark maze.
Unfortunately, the hole above you is much too high to reach.
But what's this? There's a piece of paper on the ground!
It looks like an advertisement for some free flags, and you can just
barely make out the map that's sketched on the back.
Free flags are pretty cool, but all you really want to do is get out of this maze!
Luckily, you brought your magnificently magestic magic marker that
you can use to write labels on anything!
Maybe it'll help you find the way out...
Congratulations! You escaped the maze and got the flag!
